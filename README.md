# PDF-Summerization
The implemented PDF text summarization code employs a two-fold approach: extractive and abstractive summarization. The extractive part involves identifying and extracting keywords that represent significant terms within the documents. Subsequently, an extractive summary is generated to capture essential information from each PDF. On the other hand, the abstractive summarization leverages the BART model, a state-of-the-art transformer architecture, to generate concise and coherent abstractive summaries.

The outcome of the process is a set of summarized documents, offering users a quick overview of the main points covered in the original PDFs. The code also provides options for generating combined summaries and analyzing readability levels, contributing to a more streamlined and accessible understanding of the underlying content. This tool is envisioned to be particularly valuable in research, document review, and information retrieval scenarios.
